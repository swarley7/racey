Logic Error in Error Counting (http3_client.go:322)**\n- **Problem**: A single stream can contribute 2 errors (write failure + close failure). This means `len(errors)` could be `2 * len(r.streams)` when all streams fail both operations.\n- **Impact**: The check `if len(errors) == len(r.streams)` would evaluate to false even when ALL streams completely failed, causing the function to incorrectly return `nil` instead of an error.\n- **Fix**: Track unique failed stream indices instead of error count:\n```go\nfailedStreams := make(map[int]bool)\n// In the loop, when error occurs:\nfailedStreams[i] = true\n// In the check:\nif len(failedStreams) == len(r.streams) {\n    return fmt.Errorf(\"all %d streams failed...\", len(r.streams))\n}\n```\n\n**2. Missing Unit Test for Individual Stream Error Handling**\n- **Problem**: Task requires \"Unit test: Continues processing if one stream errors\" but no such test exists.\n- **Evidence**: Tests in http3_client_test.go only test \"no streams\" and \"empty streams\" cases, not actual error scenarios on individual streams during processing.\n- **Fix**: Add a unit test with mock streams that simulate write/close errors and verify other streams still complete.\n\n### Minor Issues\n\n**3. No Defensive Nil Check for Streams (http3_client.go:298-311)**\n- While unlikely, if r.streams[i] is nil, calling Write() or Close() would panic.\n- Recommendation: Add `if stream == nil { continue }` in the loop.\n\n### Not Counted Against This Task\n\n**Delay Flag Integration**: The acceptance criterion \"Delay before sync is configurable (reuses -delay flag)\" is NOT a blocker for this task because:\n- Task racey-oya.6 explicitly covers \"Add CLI flags and protocol selection in main.go\"\n- The delay will be applied in main.go BEFORE calling sendFinalBytes()\n- sendFinalBytes() correctly implements the tight loop without delays\n\n**Dead Code**: Functions only called from tests is expected for task 4/6 of an epic. Production usage will come in task racey-oya.6.\n\n## Required Changes\n1. Fix the error counting logic to track unique failed streams (map or set) rather than total error count\n2.
